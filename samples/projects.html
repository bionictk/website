            <h3><a href="projects/visar.pdf">VisAR: Bringing Interactivity to Static Data Visualizations through Augmented Reality</a></h3>
            <p>Static visualizations have analytic and expressive value. However,
              many interactive tasks cannot be completed using static visualizations.
              As datasets grow in size and complexity, static visualizations
              start losing their analytic and expressive power for interactive data
              exploration. Despite this limitation of static visualizations, there are
              still many cases where visualizations are limited to being static (e.g.,
              visualizations on presentation slides or posters). We believe in many
              of these cases, static visualizations will benefit from allowing users
              to perform interactive tasks on them. Inspired by the introduction of
              numerous commercial personal augmented reality (AR) devices, we
              propose an AR solution that allows interactive data exploration of
              datasets on static visualizations. In particular, we present a prototype
              system named VisAR that uses the Microsoft Hololens to enable
              users to complete interactive tasks on static visualizations.

            <h3><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7504726/">Redirected head gaze to support AR meetings distributed over heterogeneous environments</a></h3>
            <p>We demonstrate a method for redirecting gaze of virtual avatars in distributed augmented reality meetings. As social cues are a necessity for effective communication, our method tries to preserve gaze awareness, one of the key elements of a face-to-face meeting. When using AR to bring multiple sites together in a distributed meeting, with different numbers of participants and physical arrangements across sites, gaze awareness is maintained regardless of the seating topology. By maintaining gaze, we hope to enhance the presence of remote attendees and improve communication among the users, making meetings in AR a practical option for teleconferencing.

            <h3>Room-scale Augmented Reality through Head-Mounted Devices</h3>
            <p>
                Created a platform for experiencing room-scale AR through HMDs. Even though numerous head-mounted displays are being released, their demonstrations and examples feature quite limited interaction. While these interactions will improve over time, we are interested in exploring a broader range of interactions than might be possible with such platforms, especially for everyday augmented reality experiences.<br>
                To test the capabilities of the system, two demos, 'Easel' and '3D plotting', were presented at an institute showcase. Easel, a 3D painter demo, allowed users to experience drawing in 3D with their bare hands. They were able to draw freely, create interactive objects and walk through the whole scene. 3D plotting was a demo that sought the advantages of walking inside data that was produced in 3D.

            <p>
                Created an android soft keyboard that recognized input errors of the user and gracefully shifted it's keys, reducing frustration due to different perceptions of the screen.<br>
                Because each user has his or her own habit of using the keyboard, a uniform layout results in typing errors. This keyboard tries to solve this problem by recognizing each user's habit and adjusting itself to it. The research was displayed as a poster at an institute conference.
